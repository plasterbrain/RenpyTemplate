# Adding your game script

- Character setup
- Player object

- Chapters
The idea is your actual story dialogue and associated labels will take place across one or more *.rpy* files in the *story* folder. That leaves *script.rpy* to handle the "flow" of the program.

Therefore in *script.rpy*, you have the `start` label, which is where you call your story labels in order and handle any branching story path logic.

- Displayables/audio
- Story related features in clients (Steam achievos, Discord RPC)
